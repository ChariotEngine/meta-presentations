Q: Who here knows which game this is?

Q: Who has played it?

# Introduction to Chariot

* General information
  * RTS game engine
  * https://github.com/ChariotEngine
  * Written in (stable) Rust
  * MIT licensed

* Lots of work to do
  * Graphics engine rewrite (SDL2 â†’ OpenGL)
  * More SLP decoding (shadow tricks, extended opcodes)
  * Fix terrain on/off-screen calculation to account for Z axis
  * Convince *you* to work on at least one piece of the project

* Social media
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChariotEngine)
  * [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ChariotEngine)

???

Explain that the windowing/input system will remain SDL2 but that the rendering will no longer use the fixed-function pipeline.

Be prepared to explain the differences between the fixed-function pipeline and OpenGL's pipeline if anyone asks.

# History of Chariot

* [Initial commit](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/commit/8ba57c1781dca2cd1b5a5dcfed8c437ac9781ed4) by [Kevin Fuller](https://github.com/angered-ghandi) on June 17th of 2016

* [My first PR for the project landed](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/commit/44462131133bcb3b8c5fa572c20ed546696ca689) on July 11th 2016

* I said ["hey I'm going to maintain this!"](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/issues/16#issuecomment-269776872) on December 30th of 2016

* I was too busy to continue working on it :-( (until about April 11th of 2017)

* Now we are here and I devote many hours to the project

# History of Chariot

The project was named `OpenAOE` before being renamed to `Chariot`

*TODO: Explain why it was renamed (social media handles and domain availability)*

---

# The DRS Format

`DRS` is a container format created by [Ensemble Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Studios).

`DRS`es consist of "tables" for each file type (for example: all `SLP`s are stored together in an `SLP` table).

```sh
GAME/DATA/BORDER.DRS:
   6 slps

GAME/DATA/GRAPHICS.DRS:
 683 slps

GAME/DATA/INTERFAC.DRS:
  50 bins
  10 shps
  98 slps
  17 wavs
 
GAME/DATA/SOUNDS.DRS:
 144 wavs
 
GAME/DATA/TERRAIN.DRS:
   4 slps
```

---

# The DRS Format

You can use [`drs-utility`](https://github.com/ChariotEngine/drs-studio) to manipulate DRS archives.

```sh
$ drs-studio list --drs-path graphics.drs
1.slp
2.slp
[..snip..]
714.slp
715.slp
```

```sh
$ drs-studio extract --drs-path graphics.drs --file-names 00412.slp
Wrote 171241 bytes to ./00412.slp
```

# The SLP Format

`SLP` is a graphics format created by [Ensemble Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Studios).

# The SLP Format

An `SLP` is a container for paletted, animated images (think `GIF`).

Q: Why didn't Ensemble Studios use `GIF`?

Q: Why didn't Ensemble Studios use `GIF`?

A: Storage and rendering optimizations!

# The SLP Format (decoding)

`SLP` frame data consists of opcodes, palette indices, and renderer commands.

```rust
// SLP opcodes are stored in the lowest 4 bits of the command byte.
let opcode = cmd_byte & 0b00001111;

match opcode {
    // Block copy
    0b0000 | 0b0100 | 0b1000 | 0b1100 => {
        let length = try!(SixUpperBit.decode(cmd_byte, cursor));
        for _ in 0..length {
            shape.pixels[(y * width + x) as usize] = try!(cursor.read_u8());
            x += 1;
        }
    }

    // Skip pixels
    0b0001 | 0b0101 | 0b1001 | 0b1101 => {
        x += try!(SixUpperBit.decode(cmd_byte, cursor)) as u32;
    }

    ...
}
```

SLP decoding code lives at [ChariotEngine/Slp](https://github.com/ChariotEngine/Slp)

# The SLP Format (rendering)

The end result is a 2D array of palette indices that we use to render color.

```glsl
index = getValueAt(spriteData, xy); // integer 0..255
color = getValueAt(palette, index); // RGBA
```

# The SLP Format (rendering)

The end result is a 2D array of palette indices that we use to render color.

```glsl
index = getValueAt(spriteData, xy); // integer 0..255
color = getValueAt(palette, index); // RGBA
```

00412.slp frame index 18

---

# The SLP Format (rendering + debugging)

The end result is a 2D array of palette indices that we use to render color.

```glsl
index = getValueAt(spriteData, xy); // integer 0..255
color = rgba(index, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // RGBA
```

![frag-zoom-debug](./images/frag-zoom-debug.png)

???

00412.slp frame index 18

---

# The BIN Format

`BIN` files are Paint Shop Pro palettes (`JASC`) which are textual RGB triples.

I do not know why Ensemble Studios used the 'bin' suffix.

```sh
JASC-PAL
0100
256
0 0 0
[..snip..]
255 255 255
```
