# Introduction to Chariot

* General information
  * RTS game engine
  * https://github.com/ChariotEngine
  * Written in (stable) Rust
  * MIT licensed

* Lots of work to do
  * Graphics engine rewrite (SDL2 â†’ OpenGL)
  * More SLP decoding (shadow tricks, extended opcodes)
  * Fix terrain on/off-screen calculation to account for Z axis
  * Convince *you* to work on at least one piece of the project

* Social media
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChariotEngine)
  * [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/ChariotEngine)

???

Explain that the windowing/input system will remain SDL2 but that the rendering will no longer use the fixed-function pipeline.

Be prepared to explain the differences between the fixed-function pipeline and OpenGL's 3D if anyone asks.

# History of Chariot

* [Initial commit](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/commit/8ba57c1781dca2cd1b5a5dcfed8c437ac9781ed4) by [Kevin Fuller](https://github.com/angered-ghandi) on June 17th of 2016

* [My first PR for the project landed](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/commit/44462131133bcb3b8c5fa572c20ed546696ca689) on July 11th 2016

* I said ["hey I'm going to maintain this!"](https://github.com/angered-ghandi/OpenAOE/issues/16#issuecomment-269776872) on December 30th of 2016

* I forgot about it / was too busy to continue working on it :-(

* Now we are here and I devote many hours to the project

# History of Chariot

The project was named `OpenAOE` before being renamed to `Chariot`

*TODO: Explain why it was renamed (social media handles and domain availability)*

# What is an SLP?

`SLP` is a home-grown graphics container format created by [Ensemble Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Studios).

# What is an SLP?

An `SLP` is a container for paletted, animated images (think `GIF`).

Q: Why didn't ES just use `GIF`?

# What is an SLP?

An `SLP` is a container for paletted, animated images (think `GIF`).

Q: Why didn't ES just use `GIF` then?

A: Storage and rendering optimizations!

# What is an SLP?

An `SLP` is a container for paletted, animated images (think `GIF`).

`SLP` frame data consists of opcodes, palette indices, and renderer commands.

*TODO: Image here*
